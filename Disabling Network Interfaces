---Disabling Network Interfaces---

I've been trying to disable virbr0, vmnet1 and vmnet8 network interfaces, Why? > It's just messy! and i'm not using any virtual machines and etc!
Open terminal
> ifconfig (mess everywhere)
> ip link set virbr0 down
> ip link set vmnet1 down
> ip link set vmnet8 down
> ifconfig (wooof! you can't see them anymore)

If you want to enable them again?
> ip link set virbr0 up (and so on)




Network Interface - A network interface is the point of interconnection between a computer and a private or public network. A network interface is generally
a network interface card (NIC), but does not have to have a physical form. Instead, the network interface can be implemented in software.
