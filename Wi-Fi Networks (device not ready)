---Wi-Fi Networks (device not ready) ERROR---

I couldn't connect to wi-fi and it's "displaying device not ready" At present i'm connected via my ethernet(eth0)

ERRORS:

1. device not ready

Fix:

> ip link set wlan0 down (Tried to reconfigure network interface wlan0)(ip stands for Internet Protocol and as the name suggests, the tool is used for 
                         configuring network interfaces.)
> ip link set wlan0 up
> service NetworkManager restart (didn't worked)

I searched for the error on google and read some blogs
> ./hotspot (tried to enable hotspot to check whether wlan0 can be run and used by hotspot)
Before: wlan0: flags=4099<UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
After: wlan0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500    (wlan0 is running)

I tried to run wlan1
